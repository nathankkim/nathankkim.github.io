Bio
======
Hi! My name is Nathan, and I'm currently a senior attending USC majoring in Biology and minoring in Computer Programming.

I am currently planning to take one year off before going to medical school with future plans to go into international medicine, family medicine, anesthesiology, or radiology.

My passions lie in Korean history and culture, cooking, video game programming, and polymathic learning of all kinds!
